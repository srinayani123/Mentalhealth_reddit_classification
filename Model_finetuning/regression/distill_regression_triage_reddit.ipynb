        "### 🧠 Triage Score Regression Model – Architecture & Code Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements a regression model using **DistilBERT** to predict triage scores from mental health-related text data. The core goal is to assign a **continuous risk score** (between 0.05 and 1.0) to each text input, representing the severity of a mental health concern. Below is a breakdown of the architecture and key stages in the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preprocessing & Scoring**:  \n",
        "   The original dataset, after combining `title` and `text` fields, is processed using a custom `compute_triage_score()` function. This function uses regular expressions to map specific mental health-related keywords to severity scores:  \n",
        "   - `1.0` for high-risk phrases like \"suicidal\", \"kill myself\"  \n",
        "   - `0.75` for moderate signs like \"panic attack\", \"worthless\"  \n",
        "   - `0.4` for mild distress indicators like \"stressed\", \"anxious\"  \n",
        "   - `0.05` is used as a default low-risk baseline score  \n",
        "   This approach ensures better label distribution for a regression model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Handling Data Imbalance**:  \n",
        "   Since high-risk samples are typically underrepresented, the script amplifies their presence by repeating them 5 times. This strategic oversampling helps the model avoid bias toward low-risk examples and learn meaningful gradients in the upper range of the score spectrum.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Tokenization**:  \n",
        "   We utilize the `distilbert-base-uncased` tokenizer to transform the text into input tokens suitable for a transformer-based model. Tokenization is done using Hugging Face’s `map()` method for efficient, batched processing of both train and test splits.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Architecture**:  \n",
        "   We load `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` with `num_labels=1` to adapt DistilBERT for a regression task. This configuration outputs a single float value per input text instead of classification logits.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Training Configuration**:  \n",
        "   The training pipeline is configured using `TrainingArguments`, specifying:\n",
        "   - 4 epochs\n",
        "   - batch size of 16\n",
        "   - learning rate: 2e-5  \n",
        "   - weight decay for regularization  \n",
        "   A custom metric function computes **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** during evaluation to track prediction quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Trainer API**:  \n",
        "   Hugging Face’s `Trainer` class handles training and evaluation efficiently. It automatically uses the appropriate dataloader, GPU acceleration (if available), and evaluation loop logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Model Saving**:  \n",
        "   After training, both the model and tokenizer are saved to disk (`triage_regression_output`) so they can be reloaded later for inference or fine-tuning without repeating training.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture is tailored for scenarios where **nuanced emotional severity** needs to be predicted from short or long mental health-related text posts, making it highly suitable for triage automation systems in digital mental health platforms.\n"

Each dot represents a sample, with the x-axis indicating the **true triage score** (discrete values: 0.05, 0.4, 0.75, or 1.0) and the y-axis representing the **model’s predicted score**. The overlaid cyan line denotes the ideal regression line (i.e., perfect prediction: `y = x`).\n",

        "From the plot, we observe a strong linear correlation between the predicted and true scores, especially for the extreme classes:\n",
        "- **High-risk instances (True Score = 1.0)** are predicted with high precision, as many points lie tightly around the (1.0, 1.0) diagonal.\n",
        "- **Moderate-risk samples (True Score = 0.75)** also show tight clustering, with predicted scores falling consistently within the 0.7–0.9 range.\n",

A large concentration of samples fall within the error range of **-0.05 to +0.05**, confirming that most predictions are very close to the actual triage labels. Specifically, the sharp peak near 0 indicates that the model consistently produces predictions that closely match the rule-based true scores.\n",

The key takeaway is that the model demonstrates **stable and symmetric error behavior across all risk levels**, with tightly grouped residuals around 0 in most categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, **high-risk samples (score = 1.0)** show minimal variance in residuals, indicating the model consistently assigns high predicted scores when they are due. Similarly, the **moderate-risk category (0.75)** has a compact interquartile range and no severe outliers, affirming that these nuanced cases are well-understood by the model.\n",

        "Interestingly, the **low-risk category (0.05)** exhibits a few high residual outliers, suggesting a small set of examples were **overestimated** by the model. This could be due to mild-risk phrases being confused with moderate-level semantics, especially if such overlaps exist in training data.\n",

        "The regression model demonstrated a strong ability to differentiate varying levels of psychological distress across diverse user inputs. The input _\"I feel so empty and worthless lately. Nothing brings me joy.\"_ was scored at **0.77**, which correctly reflects elevated emotional distress associated with hopelessness and self-worth loss—consistent with how the model was trained to flag depressive patterns. Similarly, the input _\"I'm scared. I can't stop shaking. Panic attacks every night.\"_ received a score of **0.74**, accurately identifying acute anxiety symptoms like fear, shaking, and panic episodes as high-risk signals. The most critical input—_\"Suicidal thoughts are getting worse. I don’t want to live anymore.\"_—was flagged with the maximum score of **1.00**, which affirms that the model prioritizes clear high-risk indicators for immediate triage.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, lower scores such as **0.19** for _\"Just overwhelmed with deadlines, but I think I'll manage.\"_ and **0.07** for _\"I've been feeling off, but I’m not sure what’s wrong.\"_ show the model's sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty and mild expressions of emotional fatigue. These responses do not convey imminent danger, and the predictions reasonably fall on the lower end of the triage spectrum.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results validate the design of the enhanced rule-based scoring function used to label the training data, which was crafted to reflect clinical severity ranges (e.g., high-risk suicide ideation vs. functional stress). The model has generalized these gradations effectively, as seen in how it adjusts its predictions based on the emotional intensity and specificity of each statement. Overall, the output justifies the use of a fine-tuned DistilBERT regression head for mental health triage, offering a nuanced, context-aware estimation of psychological risk across varied narratives.\n"

        "📊 **Evaluation Metrics Interpretation: Regression Model for Triage Scoring**\n",

        "The regression model's performance metrics confirm its robustness and high predictive accuracy. A **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** of **0.0274** indicates that, on average, the predicted triage scores deviate from the true scores by less than 3 percentage points—an impressively low margin considering the scale ranges from 0 to 1. The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** of **0.0039** and the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of **0.0628** further reinforce this, showing that even the squared deviations (which penalize larger errors more) remain minimal, reflecting stable and consistent predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most notably, the **R² Score** of **0.9709** suggests that over 97% of the variance in the true triage scores is explained by the model’s predictions. This level of fit is rarely observed in real-world regression applications and demonstrates the model’s exceptional ability to learn the nuanced patterns from the handcrafted triage scoring function, especially after incorporating risk-aware data augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these metrics validate that the regression model is both precise and generalizable, making it suitable for sensitive applications like mental health triage where interpretability and accuracy are equally important.\n"

        "\n",
        "The mental health triage regression model demonstrates consistently high performance across all evaluation checkpoints, validating its suitability for real-world application. The **true vs. predicted scatter plot** shows a strong linear alignment, indicating that the model captures risk levels accurately across the entire triage score range. This is reinforced by the **residual plots**, which show low variance and no signs of systematic bias across different severity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **prediction error histogram** highlights that the majority of errors are concentrated around zero, indicating the model rarely over- or under-predicts by large margins. This tight clustering is a direct result of our improved data augmentation strategy, which oversamples high-risk instances to ensure the model learns from critical cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the **regression evaluation metrics** provide quantitative backing: a **Mean Absolute Error of 0.0274** and an **R² score of 0.9709** confirm that the model not only predicts accurately but also generalizes well. The **residuals grouped by true score bins** show that even for extreme cases like suicidal ideation (`score = 1.0`), the model's predictions stay close, rarely deviating by more than ±0.1.\n",
        "\n",
        "In qualitative testing, the model correctly assigned higher triage scores to inputs expressing suicidal intent or intense panic, while downscaling milder expressions of stress. For example, a text mentioning *“Suicidal thoughts are getting worse”* received a score of **1.00**, while *“Overwhelmed with deadlines”* scored **0.19**, accurately reflecting real-world triage priorities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taken together, the combination of **low error, high R², minimal residual bias**, and **strong semantic alignment** in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations justifies selecting this model as the best-performing solution for nuanced mental health triage tasks.\n"
