        "This notebook implements a fine-tuned **regression model using Sharpaxis/Mental-Health-RoBERTa**, a transformer model specialized for mental health text. The goal is to **predict a triage score (0 to 1)** that reflects the severity or urgency of the mental state described in the input text.\n",

        "### 🧠 1. **Triage Scoring Function**\n",
        "A custom `compute_triage_score()` function applies **rule-based heuristics** to assign a soft label to each text based on severity:\n",
        "- **High-risk** (score = 1.0): contains suicidal ideation or life-threatening cues.\n",
        "- **Moderate-risk** (score = 0.75): mentions panic, numbness, or emotional paralysis.\n",
        "- **Mild-risk** (score = 0.4): mentions stress, burnout, or general anxiety.\n",
        "- **Default floor** (score = 0.05): if no known distress indicators are matched.\n",

        "This scatter plot illustrates the alignment between predicted and true triage scores in the regression model. Each dot represents a sample, where the x-axis corresponds to the true triage score (ranging from 0.05 to 1.0) and the y-axis indicates the model’s predicted score. The ideal scenario would see all points lying along the diagonal reference line, which denotes perfect predictions. Here, the trend line follows a strong positive slope, showing that the model effectively captures the overall risk gradient. High-risk texts (score = 1.0) are mostly predicted with scores close to or above 0.9, and lower-risk instances (score = 0.05 or 0.4) are also distinctly separated. There is some vertical spread — particularly in low and mid ranges — indicating minor prediction variance, but no systematic bias or collapse."

        "The histogram above shows how far off the model's predicted triage scores are from the true values. Most of the predictions fall very close to the actual scores, with the majority of errors centered tightly around zero. This means the model tends to make only small mistakes—either slightly overestimating or underestimating. There are only a few cases where the error is noticeably large, and those are rare outliers. The overall shape is narrow and balanced, which indicates that the model is not only accurate but also consistent in its predictions across different levels of risk."

        "This residual plot highlights how prediction errors vary across different triage score categories. Each box represents the spread of residuals (difference between predicted and true scores) for a given label. For both low-risk (0.05, 0.4) and high-risk (0.75, 1.0) cases, the model shows tight clustering around zero, suggesting minimal bias in any specific direction. The residuals are generally balanced, with slightly more variation in the 0.4 group, which is expected due to the broader linguistic ambiguity in moderate-risk language. Importantly, even the high-risk scores do not exhibit significant underestimation—reaffirming the model’s reliability in identifying critical cases. This consistent residual behavior across score levels is a strong indicator of model stability"

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is just 0.0476, indicating that, on average, the predicted triage scores deviate from true scores by less than 5 percentage points. This level of error is impressively low for a nuanced mental health triage task.\n",

In practical terms, this indicates a very high degree of explanatory power and prediction consistency.\n",
