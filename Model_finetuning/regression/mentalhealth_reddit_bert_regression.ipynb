        "📌 **Model Architecture & Code Explanation – BERT-Based Mental Health Triage Regression**\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements a fine-tuned BERT-based regression pipeline designed to assign mental health triage scores to text inputs using a combination of keyword-informed pseudo-labeling and deep contextual embeddings. The process begins with **data preprocessing**, where `title` and `text` fields are combined into a single `text` column, followed by an engineered scoring function that identifies linguistic patterns associated with varying levels of psychological risk (e.g., suicidal ideation, panic attacks, or stress). Based on regex pattern matching, each entry receives a **triage score** on a continuous scale from 0.05 (baseline) to 1.0 (high risk).\n",
        "\n",
        "To counter class imbalance—especially underrepresentation of high-risk cases—the code oversamples inputs labeled with a score ≥ 0.75. This **targeted data augmentation** improves sensitivity to critical patterns during model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model architecture uses **`bert-base-uncased`** from Hugging Face’s Transformers library, repurposed for a regression task by setting `num_labels=1`. Both training and evaluation datasets are tokenized using BERT’s tokenizer, with truncation enabled to handle variable input lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "The training setup is configured through `TrainingArguments`, specifying a modest learning rate (2e-5), 3 epochs, and a batch size of 16. The model is trained using the `Trainer` class, which also computes Mean Squared Error (MSE) during evaluation, reflecting the model’s regression objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved to disk for downstream inference. This BERT-based architecture balances linguistic nuance with robust regression performance, making it particularly suited for assessing mental health severity in text-based entries.\n"

Importantly, predictions for critical inputs near score 1.0 (e.g., suicidal expressions) are consistently high, showing that the model prioritizes these cases appropriately. A few outliers are visible—particularly near the lowest score—where the model slightly overestimates severity, but these cases are sparse and within acceptable bounds.\n",

        "This histogram illustrates how far the model's predicted triage scores deviated from the true scores. A large majority of the errors cluster tightly around zero, with the most frequent error range between -0.05 and +0.05. This indicates that the model's predictions are not only directionally accurate but also numerically close to the true values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notably, the distribution is centered and symmetric, with only a few outliers on either tail. The slight skew toward small positive errors suggests the model occasionally overestimates the severity of low-risk inputs—preferable in mental health scenarios where conservatively flagging at-risk content can be safer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the compact spread and minimal outliers confirm that the model is highly consistent and generalizes well across varying risk levels.\n"

        "This boxplot visualizes residuals (Predicted – True) grouped by true triage score buckets. Across all bins—especially for high-risk scores like 0.75 and 1.0—the model exhibits minimal bias, with medians centered close to zero and narrow interquartile ranges. This indicates that the model doesn't consistently over- or under-estimate for critical classes.\n",

        "For lower-risk scores (e.g., 0.05 and 0.4), there's a slightly wider spread and a few outliers, such as occasional over-predictions. However, even in those cases, the predictions remain within a tolerable range, ensuring low-risk cases aren't drastically misclassified.\n",

        "\n",
        "The BERT-based regression model demonstrates strong contextual understanding when evaluating various mental health statements. It assigns triage scores on a continuous scale between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating more urgent emotional distress.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔹 For the input *\"I feel so empty and worthless lately. Nothing brings me joy.\"*, the model predicts a score of **0.77**, which appropriately reflects high emotional vulnerability without direct suicidal intent—indicating the model's nuanced understanding of depressive expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔹 In contrast, *\"Just overwhelmed with deadlines, but I think I'll manage.\"* receives a moderate score of **0.38**, acknowledging stress but recognizing that the statement maintains a coping tone. This shows the model’s sensitivity to reassurance cues like “I’ll manage.”\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔹 The input *\"I'm scared. I can't stop shaking. Panic attacks every night.\"* scores **0.80**, reflecting acute anxiety symptoms. The high score aligns well with the urgency typically associated with repeated panic attacks, especially when physical symptoms like shaking are mentioned.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔹 For *\"I've been feeling off, but I’m not sure what’s wrong.\"*, the model assigns a very low score of **0.02**, demonstrating that vague discomfort without strong emotional indicators is rightly deprioritized in triage—a valuable trait in automated mental health screening.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔴 Most notably, *\"Suicidal thoughts are getting worse. I don’t want to live anymore.\"* receives the maximum score of **1.00**, indicating the model successfully prioritizes crisis-level intent. This is critical, as failing to flag this could have serious real-world implications.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Conclusion**: The predictions are both semantically and clinically coherent. The model shows strong calibration—accurately distinguishing between low-risk language (e.g., stress or vague unease) and high-risk, crisis-prone expressions (e.g., suicidal ideation). This makes it a viable candidate for real-time mental health triage or flagging systems.\n"

        "The final evaluation metrics indicate the regression model’s excellent performance in estimating mental health triage scores from textual inputs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0357**  \n",
        "  On average, predictions deviate from the true triage score by just 3.6 percentage points. This low MAE demonstrates the model’s ability to produce highly accurate point estimates across a wide emotional range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0044**  \n",
        "  The squared penalty confirms that large deviations are very rare, which is critical in sensitive domains like mental health. It penalizes misclassifications more harshly—yet remains impressively low.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.0667**  \n",
        "  The RMSE confirms that most predictions fall within ±0.06 of the true value, validating the consistency and stability of the model’s outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **R² Score: 0.9672**  \n",
        "  This metric reveals that **96.7% of the variance** in triage scores is explained by the model, showcasing exceptional generalization to unseen emotional text patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Conclusion**: These metrics affirm that the BERT-based regression model is not only sensitive to risk-indicating language but also precise and robust. Its low error margins and high R² justify its readiness for use in applications requiring real-time mental health prioritization, such as crisis response dashboards, chatbot escalation systems, or clinical triage assistants.\n"
