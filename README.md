# üß† Mental Health Reddit Post Classifier and Triage Score Estimator

This project builds and evaluates NLP models to classify mental health conditions and assign a triage severity score to Reddit posts, enabling early identification and prioritization of at-risk users in online communities.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Online mental health communities often receive thousands of posts daily, many of which contain subtle signs of emotional distress or suicidal ideation. Manual moderation is time-consuming and inconsistent. The goal is to build a system that can automatically classify posts into conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety) and estimate the urgency (triage score) to assist in early intervention.

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

I fine-tuned multiple transformer models on annotated Reddit data to classify posts into five mental health categories and regress a continuous triage score based on linguistic patterns of risk. This dual modeling approach allows both categorical tagging and prioritization of cases needing attention.

## üìÇ Data Description

The dataset consists of Reddit posts collected from various mental health-related subreddits. Each record contains:

- `title`: Post title
- `text`: Body of the post
- `target`: Integer label (0‚Äì4), representing one of five mental health conditions:
  - **0** ‚Äì Depression  
  - **1** ‚Äì Anxiety  
  - **2** ‚Äì Bipolar Disorder  
  - **3** ‚Äì Personality Disorder  
  - **4** ‚Äì Stress

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Combined `title` and `text` fields.
   - Handled missing values.
   - Mapped target labels and created `triage_score` using regex-based heuristics.

2. **Model Selection**  
   - **Classification**:  
     - `bert-base-uncased`  
     - `distilbert-base-uncased`  
     - `roberta-base`  
     - `Sharpaxis/Mental-Health-RoBERTa` (domain-specific)  
   - **Regression**:  
     - Same models adapted for single-output regression.

3. **Tokenization & Training**  
   - Used respective model tokenizers with truncation/padding.
   - Applied stratified train/test split.
   - Fine-tuned models using `Trainer` with evaluation metrics: accuracy (classification), MSE (regression).

4. **Triage Scoring**  
   - Regex patterns categorized language into low/mild/moderate/high-risk.
   - High-risk samples were upweighted to ensure model learns severity scale.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- **Classification**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score (weighted + per class)
- **Regression**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE), qualitative analysis of predicted vs expected scores.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion & Model Justification

Among the evaluated models, Mental-Health-RoBERTa consistently delivered the highest classification accuracy, coupled with strong recall across all five mental health condition classes. This is especially critical in clinical or support-related applications, where failing to detect high-risk cases (false negatives) can have serious consequences. The domain-specific pretraining on mental health-related corpora allowed this model to better understand subtle linguistic patterns such as fragmented expressions, indirect distress signals, and colloquial phrases commonly found in online support forums or Reddit posts.

On the regression side, DistilBERT offered a compelling trade-off between performance and efficiency. Despite having fewer parameters, it generalized well across the triage score spectrum (0.05 to 1.0), with tightly clustered predictions around true scores, especially for moderate to high-risk cases. It also trained significantly faster than heavier models like BERT or RoBERTa, making it more practical for iterative experimentation or real-time scoring applications.

Overall, the results highlight that:

Domain-adapted language models (e.g., Mental-Health-RoBERTa) are far better suited for nuanced classification tasks involving emotional or psychological language.

Lightweight transformers like DistilBERT are highly effective for regression tasks where subtle variations in risk must be quantified, offering speed without compromising reliability.

The choice of model should ultimately depend on the deployment setting ‚Äî for high-stakes triage or moderation, prioritizing recall with domain knowledge is key; for scalable or real-time risk estimation, general-purpose distilled models may suffice.
